THE BOBBSEY TWINS ON BLUEBERRY ISLAND


CHAPTER I

THE GYPSIES


"Oh, dear! I wish we weren't going home!"

"So do I! Can't we stay out a little while longer?"

"Why, Flossie and Freddie Bobbsey!" cried Nan, the older sister of the
two small twins who had spoken. "A few minutes ago you were in a hurry
to get home."

"Yes; they said they were so hungry they couldn't wait to see what Dinah
was going to have for supper," said Bert Bobbsey. "How about that,
Freddie?"

"Well, I'm hungry yet," said the little boy, who was sitting beside his
sister Flossie in a boat that was being rowed over the blue waters of
Lake Metoka. "I am hungry, and I want some of Dinah's pie, but I'd like
to stay out longer."

"So would I," added Flossie. "It's so nice on the lake, and maybe
to-morrow it will rain."

"Well, what if it does?" asked Nan. "You didn't expect to come out on
the lake again to-morrow, did you?"

"Maybe," answered Flossie, as she smoothed out the dress of a doll she
was holding in her lap.

"I'd like to come out on the lake and have a picnic every day," said
