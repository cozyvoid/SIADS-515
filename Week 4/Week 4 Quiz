3. O Notation tells us...

    > the exact runtime of an algorithm
    > how runtime requirements scale to size of input data

4. O-Notation is meant to model performance under...

    > the best-case conditions
    > the worst-case conditions

5. At your summer internship you find yourself asked to write an algorithm that runs in “constant time.” Which of the below notations does this correspond with?

    > O(c)
    > O(0)
    > O(1)
    > O(θ), or simply θ

6. Indexing a single element in an array is an operation that could be said to run in ____ time?

    > constant
    > linear
    > quadratic
    > logarithmic time

7. After a programming interview, you receive critical feedback that your implementation of a function unnecessarily takes exponential time when the expectation was for it to run in linear time. Which of the following statements are valid:

    > The function runtime is expected to remain consistent regardless of input size.
    > The function runtime currently scales proportionately to input size.
    > The function runtime currently doubles for each positive incrementation to the input size.
