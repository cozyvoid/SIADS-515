Basic Data Structures

Lists

    - Ordered and mutable collections in Python.
    - Can contain mixed data types.
    - Initialized using square brackets, either [] or list().
    - Indexed from zero, where the first element is element zero.
    - Accessing an empty list's zeroth element results in an IndexError.

Examples include operations like list slicing, negative indexing, and list concatenation.

List Operations
    
    - Understanding appending vs. extending lists.
    - Using deep copying with list.copy() to avoid modifications to the original list when copied.
    - List comprehensions and their efficiency in creating lists, including usage of map and lambda.

Advanced Data Structures

Tuples

    - Similar to lists but immutable (unchangeable).
    - Importance of immutability is that they are hashable and can be used as keys in dictionaries.
    - Initialized using parentheses, but a single-element tuple requires a trailing comma.
    - Useful in functions that require read-only collections.

Sets

    - Unordered collections that contain unique values.
    - Initialized using braces {}.
    - Set operations include union, intersection, and difference.

Example demonstrated checking uniqueness in words and elements.

Dictionaries

    - Collections mapping keys to values.
    - Keys must be hashable and are commonly strings.
    - Initialized using braces with key: value pairs.

Example shown of city populations dictionary demonstrating common operations such as accessing, checking keys, and iteration.

Key Concepts

    > Mutability vs. Immutability: Lists are mutable, enabling appends and modifications, while tuples are immutable, providing a stable collection type useful in certain programming contexts.
    > Copy Behavior: Standard copying in lists points to the same memory address; a deep copy is necessary to create an independent copy.
    > List Comprehensions: Efficient method for generating lists based on existing collections or ranges.
    > Uniqueness in Sets: Sets automatically discard duplicate values, providing a mechanism for ensuring uniqueness.
    > Dictionaries as Key-Value Stores: Ideal for mappings where quick access to data based on a unique key is required.
