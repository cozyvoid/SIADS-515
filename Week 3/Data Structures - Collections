Data Structures Overview

    - The transition from basic to advanced data structures aims to simplify repetitive coding patterns.
    - Introduction to the Python collections package, highlighting its utility in providing advanced alternatives to basic data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.
    - Focused on four key advanced data structures: Counter, defaultdict, deque, and namedtuple.

Counters

    - Usage: Counting the frequency of elements in a list.
    - Characteristics: A subclass of dictionaries with simplified methods for element counting.
    - Example Functions:
        > most_common(): Returns the most frequent elements.
        > Example: In a list of letters, quickly identify the most common ones.

DefaultDicts
    - Problem Solved: Simplifies the process of initializing dictionary values.
    - Functionality: Automatically provides a default value for new keys, eliminating the need for manual checks.

Deques (Double-Ended Queue)

    - Purpose: Efficiently pop elements from either end of a list.
    - Features: \
        > More efficient than lists for certain operations.
        > Supports advanced operations like rotation (rotate()).
    - Application Example: Implementing a moving average calculation.

NamedTuples

    - Advantage: Enhances code readability by allowing fields to be accessed by name rather than position.
    - Usage: Ideal for structured data where field names enhance code clarity.
    - Example: Create a coord object with fields latitude and longitude.
