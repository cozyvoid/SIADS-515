1. Introduction to Debugging

Overview: Emphasis on debugging as a crucial skill in programming, focusing not just on identifying errors but also on fixing them.
    Example Highlighted:
    Initial code block with a typo: print toknow.
    Encountered a NameError.
    Correction by changing to print token.

2. Understanding Tracebacks

Key Concepts:
    Starting Point: Begin reading tracebacks from the bottom to identify the primary error.
    Stack Trace: Follows the sequence of function calls leading to the error.
    Demonstration:
    Example with functions count_unique and preprocessed_text.
    Encountered NameError due to incorrect variable casing (I instead of i).
    Step-by-step tracing from the module level down to the specific line causing the error.

3. Common Python Errors and Solutions

    a. NameError
    Cause: Accessing variables that haven't been defined or have typographical errors.
    Solutions:
        - Ensure correct variable initialization.
        - Check for consistent variable naming, especially in nested loops.
    b. AttributeError
    Cause: Accessing nonexistent attributes of an object.
    Example:
    Attempting to access value attribute of a list object.
    Solutions:
        - Consult documentation to verify correct attribute names.
        - Avoid typos and ensure the attribute exists for the object type.
    c. ImportError
    Cause: Issues with module imports, such as incorrect module names or missing components.
    Examples:
    Incorrect import statement: import scikit Learn leading to ModuleNotFoundError.
    Correct import using alias: import sklearn.
    Specific component import issues: from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB instead of incorrect class names.
    Solutions:
        - Verify module names and their correct casing.
        - Use appropriate aliases as per documentation.
        - Ensure the specific components being imported exist within the module.
    d. IndexError
    Cause: Accessing list indices that are out of the valid range.
    Example:
    Accessing numbers[3] in a list of three elements (indices 0-2).
    Solutions:
        - Adjust index values to be within the valid range.
        - Use try-except blocks to handle potential out-of-range access gracefully.
    e. KeyError
    Cause: Accessing non-existent keys in dictionaries.
    Example:
    Accessing word_counts['I'] when the key 'I' doesn't exist.
    Solutions:
        - Use the get method to safely retrieve values.
        - Check for key existence using conditional statements before access.
    f. SyntaxError
    Cause: Incorrect Python syntax, such as missing colons, parentheses, or improper indentation.
    Examples:
    Missing parentheses in print statements (print word_counts[i] without parentheses in Python 3).
    Missing colon in loop declarations.
    Solutions:
        - Carefully review and correct the syntax as per Python's rules.
        - Utilize Python 3 syntax, especially for functions like print().
    g. TypeError
    Cause: Performing operations on incompatible data types.
    Example:
        Adding an integer and a string: C = A + B where A = 1 and B = "1".
    Solutions:
        - Ensure data types are compatible for the intended operation.
        - Use type casting where appropriate, e.g., converting strings to integers before addition.
    h. ValueError
    Cause: Operations receiving arguments of the correct type but inappropriate value.
    Examples:
    Converting a non-numeric string to an integer: int('a').
    Unpacking mismatched number of values from a list.
    Solutions:
        - Validate values before performing operations.
        - Ensure the number of variables matches the number of values when unpacking.

4. Practical Demonstrations

> Notebook Walkthrough:
    - Multiple code blocks were demonstrated in a notebook environment to showcase each error type.
    - Step-by-step debugging was performed, illustrating how to identify and fix each error.
> Handling Exceptions:
    - Introduction to using try and except blocks to manage potential errors without terminating the program.
    - Examples included handling IndexError and KeyError gracefully.
> Action Items
    - Practice Debugging:
    - Apply the discussed error-fixing techniques in personal coding projects.
    - Revisit existing code to identify and correct potential errors using the outlined methods.
    - Study Documentation:
        Familiarize with documentation of commonly used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Pyplot, and Scikit-Learn to prevent AttributeError and ImportError.
    - Implement Exception Handling:
    - Incorporate try and except blocks in code to handle foreseeable errors and enhance program robustness.

Upcoming Sessions:
> Further exploration of exception handling in Python, focusing on advanced techniques beyond try and except.
Introduction to debugging tools and integrated development environment (IDE) features that aid in identifying and resolving errors.

Assignments:
> Complete exercises that involve intentionally introducing errors into code and practicing their identification and resolution.
> Develop a small project incorporating multiple types of error handling to solidify understanding.

Conclusion
> The session provided a comprehensive overview of common Python errors, strategies to read and interpret tracebacks, and practical methods to debug and fix issues effectively. Emphasizing hands-on practice and familiarity with library documentation was highlighted as essential for becoming proficient in Python debugging.
