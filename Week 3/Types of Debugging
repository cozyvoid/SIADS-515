Overview of Debugging Techniques

Print Debugging

    > Description: Utilizes print statements to track code flow and variable states. This helps identify anomalies or issues within the code by outputting intermediate values.
    > Pros and Cons: It's a common method in Python, especially in cases where large amounts of data are involved. However, it can clutter the code and slow down processes when dealing with large outputs.
    > Practical Example: By printing steps and checking values like latitude and longitude, you ensure they are as expected.
    > Caution: Be wary of excessive output which can slow down notebooks. Remove lengthy print outputs to maintain efficiency.

Interactive Debugging

    > Tools: PDB (Python Debugger), IPDB, Pixie Debugger.
    > Pixie Debugger: Mentioned as a visual debugger specifically useful for Jupyter notebooks. Introduces concepts like stepping through the code, setting breakpoints, and resuming execution.
    > Workflow:
        - Setting Breakpoints: Pause code execution at specific lines for examination.
        - Examining Stacks: Allows stepping into function calls or stepping out to higher call stacks.

Post Mortem Debugging

    > Description: A form of interactive debugging occurring after a crash, useful for diagnosing why an error occurred based on program state at crash time.

Discussion on Error Handling

    > Data Debugging: Identify and resolve data-specific issues like format errors or conversion problems.
    > Casting Issues: Error handling strategies such as using try-except blocks to capture conversion errors and return alternative values like numpy.nan.

Example: Finding Maximum Value

    > Initial Problem: Simple function findmax failed to return the correct maximum due to an error in conditional logic.
    > Debugging with Pixie:
        - Set Breakpoints: Identify where the logic fails by examining variable states.
        - Modified Logic: Adjusted incorrect conditional from < to > in if statement.

Recommendations

    > Using Pre-existing Solutions: Often, functions like findmax are unnecessary as libraries or standard functions may offer these capabilities.
    > Utilizing Community Resources: Many issues have been encountered before; leveraging forums like Stack Overflow can provide solutions quickly.

Key Takeaways

    - Despite its pitfalls, print debugging is widespread due to its simplicity.
    - Interactive debugging tools offer more advanced capabilities, helping to dissect complex errors more efficiently.
    - Awareness of data integrity is crucial; many issues stem from errors within the dataset rather than the code itself.
