Debugging Tactics

1. Print Debugging: Emphasized as a primary technique, frequently used in debugging processes.
2. Interactive Debugging: Introduction to the Pixie debugger, a graphical tool available in Jupyter Notebooks.
3. Control Flow Analysis: Mentioned briefly but not a focus of the discussion.
4. Unit Testing: Discussed for testing basic functionality of functions.
5. Profiling: Time will be dedicated to understanding profiling techniques.

Data-Related Bugs
    - Bugs can sometimes originate from faulty data rather than code errors.
    - An emphasis on fixing data issues instead of writing extensive code for edge cases, highlighting efficiency in time and resource allocation.

Efficient Debugging
    - Aim to integrate efficient debugging practices within the scope of efficient data processing.
    - Making trade-offs between code development and data correction while debugging.

Understanding Python Tracebacks
    - Concept Explanation: A traceback (or stack trace/backtrace) in Python occurs when an exception is raised and not caught, providing detailed error information.
    - Example Discussion: A simple code snippet with a typo-induced NameError is used to exemplify how a traceback pinpoints the error's location.

Traceback Example:
    > Creation of a list of strings with variable tokens.
    > For loop intended to print each element.
    > Typographical error (tokn instead of token) leads to a NameError, demonstrating the tracebackâ€™s ability to identify and locate errors in code.

    token = ['two', 'blue', 'bike', 'umbrella']
    for i in token():
        

Practical Advice:
    - Recognize the importance of balancing fun in coding with practical tasks like data fixing.
    - Consider the economical use of time and money in both coding and debugging phases.
