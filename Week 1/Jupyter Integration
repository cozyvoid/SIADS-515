Accessing Shell Commands from Jupyter:

Integration with Jupyter: 
    > It's possible to execute shell commands directly from within a Jupyter notebook.
    > 'History' Command: Demonstrates the use of the history command to review previously executed shell commands, which can be helpful for tracking and understanding the sequence of actions taken.

Using Exclamation Mark/Bang in Jupyter:
    > Prefix for Shell Commands: In Jupyter notebooks, shell commands can be run by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, referred to as "bang."

    Examples of Usage:
        > !ls: Lists the contents of the current directory.
        > !ls.. of the parent directory: Shows files in the parent directory, useful for file navigation.

Assigning Command Output to Variables:

    > Capturing Command Output: The output of shell commands can be assigned to Python variables.
    
    Example: 
        > a = !ls captures the directory listing into a list, which can be accessed element by element.

- Benefits include the ability to traverse and manipulate files programmatically.

Additional Tips:
    > Viewing File Content: Use commands like !head data/ride_final.csv to preview files.
    > Dual Approach: Shell commands can be executed both directly in the terminal or from within a Jupyter notebook using the bang syntax.
