Linux
    > Linux command line is a text interface to your computer
    > Other names: shell, terminal, console, prompt, etc.

History
    > Unix (early operating system) designed to run as a multi-user system on mainframe computers, with users connecting to it remotely via individual terminals
    > These terminals were pretty basic by modern standards: just a keyboard and screen, with no power to run programs locally
    > therefore, any programs that ran on the mainframe had to produce text as an output and accept text as an input
    > Unix mainframe via a terminal users still had to manage the sort of file management tasks that you might now perform with a mouse and a couple of windows
    > users in the 70s could do everything entirely with a textual interface
    > Linux is a sort-of-descendent of Unix, youâ€™re most likely to be using a shell called bash.

Commands
    > Each of these tasks required its own program or command: 
        - change directories (cd)
        - list their contents (ls)
        - rename or move files (mv)
