> Shell redirection (|) , commonly known as "piping", allows users to direct the output of commands either to a file or another command. 

Here are some key methods and examples:
    
    > Redirecting Output to a File: The greater-than sign (>) can be used to send the output of a command to a file. 
        - For example, using the head command on a file can redirect the first few lines to a new file called firstfewlines.txt.
    > Piping Between Commands: The pipe symbol (|) enables the output of one command to become the input of another. 
        - For instance, after extracting the first few lines of a file with head, the result can be piped to grep to search for a specific word like 'data'. The sequence can be extended by redirecting the final output to a file, such as fewdata.txt.
