---Linux File System and Basic Commands

Introduction to Linux File System
    > The Linux file system is akin to Finder on a Mac or File Explorer on Windows.
    > Files are organized into directories, referred to as folders in other OS environments.

Basic Commands
    > ls: Stands for "list"; lists directory contents.
    > cd: Stands for "change directory"; changes the current working directory.
    > pwd: Stands for "print working directory"; displays the current directory path.

    Exploring the ls Command
        > No Arguments: ls lists files and directories in the current directory.
        > Single Argument: Example ls data lists contents of the "data" directory.
    
Options:
    -l: Long listing format, providing detailed information about files.
    -a or --all: Displays all files, including hidden ones.
    -h: Human-readable sizes, usually used with -l.
    -t: Sort by modification time, newest first.

---Command Line Arguments

Forms of Arguments:
    > No dashes (e.g., ls data).
    > Single dash (e.g., ls -l).
    > Double dash (e.g., ls --all), which is a newer, more descriptive format.
    > Detailed View with ls -l

Columns:
    > File permissions, indicating read, write, and execute capabilities.
    > Number of links to the file.
    > User and group ownership.
    > File size in bytes.
    > Last modification date and time.
    > File Permissions
    > Permissions are displayed in three groups of three (e.g., rw-r--r--).

Groups:
    > User permissions (owner).
    > Group permissions.
    > Permissions for others.
    > Directories have execute permissions (x) to allow changing into that directory.

---Navigating with cd

    > cd <directory>: Changes into the specified directory.
    > cd ..: Moves to the parent directory.


Special Characters:
    > Dot (.) refers to the current directory.
    > Double dot (..) refers to the parent directory.
    > Root directory is represented by a single slash (/).
    > Home directory is often represented by a tilde (~).

---Printing Directory Path with pwd
    > Displays the absolute path of the current directory.

Absolute vs. Relative Paths:
    > Absolute paths start with a slash and specify a complete path from the root.
    > Relative paths do not start with a slash and specify a path relative to the current directory.
